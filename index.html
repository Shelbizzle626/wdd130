        <p>Utah is a beautiful place to live. We have mountains, lakes, rivers, green spaces, red
            rocks, snow. You really couldn't ask for more.
            There is so much to do in Utah. I love to go to the lake. I have 2 within 10 minutes of
            my house. My kids love to ski and my husband
            and daughter love to moutnain bike.</p>
